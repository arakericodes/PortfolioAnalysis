This project presents a comprehensive portfolio analysis evaluating allocation structure, performance attribution, and risk-adjusted returns over the period 2020–2025.

The objective was to assess how portfolio construction decisions impacted returns relative to major benchmarks, while quantifying concentration risk and volatility exposure.

Tools Used:

Power BI

DAX (CAGR, compounded return, drawdown, volatility, tracking error)

Excel (data preparation)
